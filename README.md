Skeletal animation using C++ and OpenGL.

## Why?

I created this project in order to explore several aspects of OpenGL and 3D animation. This includes but is not limitied to: lighting, shadow maps, texturing, model loading, animations and skeletal representations.

## Building and running

To run the code, enter the build directory and run CMake.

```console
cd ./build
cmake ..
```

The build directory will then be populated by a VS Project or a make file that can be used to run the project.

This has been tested and works on my Windows and Linux machine.

## Movement

The model can be moved by using the WASD keys along with the spacebar to jump.

## About the 3D model

The model, textures and animations are all made by [Mixamo](https://www.mixamo.com/#/).
